Merge Bullet Clone

Our aim in this game is to combine foods to obtain stronger foods and to destroy more walls at the end of the game. I added combining foods as the first game mechanic. As the second game mechanic, I added walls at the beginning of the game. It selects those who can pass through these walls according to the level of food. It randomly selects the ones that will pass among the selected ones. As the third game mechanic, the food comes into the pans and is thrown forward from the pans like bullets. As the fourth game mechanic, I made four different gates. These gates can increase the size of the food and double its damage, allow us to throw three foods at the same time, change the speed of throwing the food, and change the distance the food travels. As the fifth game mechanic, we can buy shields like gates. This shield prevents us from taking one-time damage. It throws something us at random times to damage us. If it hits us, it deals damage, and if it hits us three times, we die immediately. As a final game mechanic, at the end of the game there are walls with healths on them. If we destroy these walls, they drop gold and we can collect this gold by passing over them.
